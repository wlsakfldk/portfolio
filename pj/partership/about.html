			<h6>ABOUT <span>US</span></h6>
			<div class="box"></div>
			<p>"InvestPlan LTD" Company was registered in March 9th, 2017 in Great Britain
				(registration<br> number #10660714) and works according to the legislation of this
				jurisdiction.</p>
			<p>InvestPlan LTD fulfills energy saving functions and works in compliance with the <br>
				normative, legislative and legal enactments. Our goal is to develop new areas, increase the <br>
				share of the company participation in international projects in energy saving and ecology.</p>
			<p>Why have we chosen a traditional nuclear power industry for investing rather than <br> 
				alternative (natural) energy?</p>
			<p>The nuclear sector provides 17% of all power consumed by mankind. In industrially <br>
				developed countries (France, Lithuania, Germany, and Sweden) where there is a deficit 
				of <br>natural power resources (oil, natural gas, coal), the production of electrical power is 
				from<br>50 to 76%.</p>
			<p>According to experts, in the nearest future the development of nuclear energy is <br>
				forecasted in countries of the Asia-Pacific region (China, India), some countries of 
				the <br>Eastern Europe (the Czech Republic, Slovakia), and countries of the former CIS <br>
				(Kazakhstan, Russia).</p>
			<p>InvestPlan LTD Company has established a number of branches in the countries where <br>
				the nuclear power industry is the main one for producing electric power. Besides, we <br>
				actively participate in projects on energy saving on the regional level, take part in <br>
				ecological programs and invest in scientific developments of technologies for nuclear <br>
				energy.</p>

			<p>Professional circuit installers, planning engineers, technologists, marketing experts and<br>
				specialists on power saving work for our company.</p>
			<p>We specialize in supplying equipment for nuclear energy and modernizing stations. In <br>
				particular, in the Russian Federation we participated in modernizing three nuclear <br>
				reactors. As a result, the total amount of power production was increased by 19%.</p>
			<p>Modern nuclear energy is being actively developed thanks to essentially new technologies <br>
				on ecology and safety, as well as from implementing new perspective innovational <br>
				solutions.</p>
			<p>We conclude agreements with ecological organizations and receive funds financed by the <br>
				companies implementing innovational technologies to minimize the waste of nuclear <br>
				reactors.</p>
			<p>As of 2017, our investment portfolio has orders for more than twenty projects on reducing <br>
				power consumption. Some projects are being already implemented, and some of them are <br>
				planned. The total amount of the orders is about one million US dollars. Our partners <br>
				are satisfied with our relatively inexpensive and safe technological solutions.</p>
			<p>You can feel safe about your investments because the InvestPlan LTD Company works on <br>
				the state and international level which guarantees stable work and profits.</p>
